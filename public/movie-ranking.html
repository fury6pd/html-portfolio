<h1>The Best Movies According to Fury</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>THis is my top movie of all-time. Morgan Freeman is a spectacular actor and the storyline is just great.</p>
<h3>Boondock Saints</h3>
<p>Although this movie is a bit gorey, its an incredible film. It was my absolute favorite for the longest time. But I'll rank it as number 2, here.</p>
<h3>Willie Wonka & the Chocolate Factory</h3>
<p>This film has to be on the list simply for Gene Wilder. Like Morgan Freeman, he's an incredible actor. Also, thsi movie has a ton of nostalgia.</p>
